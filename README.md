# AutoDex

This is a prototype of a blockchain-based car ownership platform; utilising the Ethereum blockchain and built using Solidity.

## How to use

The easiest way to test or try the decentralised application is by navigating to the AutoDex [website](https://autodex.vercel.app/).
However, because it is a dApp, the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/en-GB/download) plugin is needed to interact with the application. There, you can create a MetaMask account.

## Where can I get free test tokens?

Thankfully, Google provides a [Sepolia faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) where you can claim free Ethereum Sepolia tokens. You can use these to complete tasks like purchasing or minting vehicles on the dApp.

## Done

You should now be able to interact with the application!
