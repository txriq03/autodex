# AutoDex

This is a prototype of a blockchain-based car ownership platform; utilising the Ethereum blockchain and built using Solidity.
The dApp is hosted on this [website](https://autodex.vercel.app/).

## Private Key

The Private Key for the demo account is: **17a98a5c10ae6051ca443a2f1ba4378318a67c0fa531718fa7471233d391624e**

## Easy set-up with private key

1. Download the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/en-GB/download) plugin and create a MetaMask account. You can access the plugin after downloading it by going to plugins in your browser (typically a puzzle piece around the top-right corner)
2. Open the plugin and click on your account name at the top
3. Click "Add acount" button, then "import account"
4. Paste in the private key shown at the top to access the demo account

## Alternative set-up if the demo account does not work

### 1. Install MetaMask

Because it is a dApp, the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/en-GB/download) plugin is needed to interact with the application. There, you can create a MetaMask account.

### 2. Switch to the Sepolia testnet

1. Open the MetaMask wallet. You can usually do this by opening your browser plugins (normally somewhere at the top-right in your browser)
2. Go to your settings by pressing the menu icon at the top-right, then go to Advanced.
3. Ensure that "Show test networks" is toggled on, then leave settings to return to the homepage
4. Open the networks page. This is usually at the top-left of the plugin window.
5. Scroll down to the "test networks" section. Make sure its toggled on and select Sepolia

### 2. Grab test tokens

Thankfully, Google provides a [Sepolia faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) where you can claim free Ethereum Sepolia tokens. You can use these to complete tasks like purchasing or minting vehicles on the dApp.

### 4. Go to the [website](https://autodex.vercel.app/) and open the MetaMask wallet. You should see the site requesting to connect to your MetaMask wallet.

### 3. Done

You should now be able to interact with the application!
